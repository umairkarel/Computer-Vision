# Virtual Magnifying Glass 

This is a virtual magnifying glass using openCV and Python.
It allows the user to magnify at specific part on the screen using just two Fingers (first & middle).

here, i have used 
* **openPose** and **cvzone** for detecting hand and the distance between the two fingers(first & middle)
* **openCV** for rest of the image processing (Display Glass, Magnify).
